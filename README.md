# Kubernetes-Project not real
✅ 2. Kubernetes Microservices App (3 services)

What you’ll build:

Frontend (React)

Backend API (Node/Python/Go)

Database (Mongo/MySQL)

Kubernetes Objects:

Deployments

Services

Horizontal Pod Autoscaler

ConfigMaps & Secrets

Ingress Controller

Why this project:

✔ Shows you understand distributed systems
✔ Looks realistic and impressive

✅ 3. Monitoring Stack on Kubernetes (Prometheus + Grafana)

What you’ll build:

Deploy Prometheus operator

Deploy Grafana

Scrape metrics from app pods

Build dashboards for CPU/RAM/network

Add Alertmanager

Extra:

Integrate Slack/email alerts.

Why this project:

✔ Monitoring + Observability is a must-have skill
✔ Interview favorite
✔ Not very hard

✅ 4. Logging Stack (EFK: Elasticsearch + FluentD + Kibana)

What you’ll deploy:

Elasticsearch (storage)

FluentD (log collector on nodes)

Kibana (UI)

Why this project:

✔ Demonstrates LOGGING — one of the most important DevOps skills
✔ Shows how DaemonSets collect logs

✅ 5. Build Your Own GitOps Setup (ArgoCD)

What you’ll build:

Install Argo CD in Kubernetes

Create a Git repo with manifests

Whenever repo changes → Argo updates your cluster

Why this:

✔ GitOps is HOT right now
✔ Very simple but extremely impressive

✅ 6. Autoscaling Based on Custom Metrics

What you’ll build:

A web app that increases CPU on load

HPA (Horizontal Pod Autoscaler)

Custom metrics using Prometheus Adapter

Why this:

✔ Shows deep Kubernetes skills
✔ Highly practical

✅ 7. Stateful Application Deployment (MySQL/Postgres + PV/PVC)

What you’ll deploy:

StatefulSet

PersistentVolume & PersistentVolumeClaim

Headless service

ConfigMap for DB config

Why this:

✔ Demonstrates understanding of storage
✔ Good for real-world scenarios

✅ 8. Build a Custom Kubernetes Operator (Easy Level)

What you’ll build:
A small operator that automates some task, like:

Ensure a Deployment always has 3 pods

Restart a pod if log contains a keyword

Auto-create ConfigMaps

Use Operator SDK or client-go.

Why this:

✔ Shows advanced K8s knowledge
✔ Almost no one does this as a student
✔ Great portfolio project
