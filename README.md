Destroy + recreate strategy

🌟 FINAL RESULT

If you complete all these 8 projects:

✔ You will be extremely strong at Kubernetes
✔ You can survive any DevOps interview
✔ You will know real-world production workflows
✔ You will build a top-tier resume

🟢 NOW — Which project do we start with?

I highly recommend:

👉 Start with Project 1: Multi-service Kubernetes App (with Ingress, ConfigMap, Probes, HPA)
because this will build the foundation for all other advanced projects.

Answer me:

⚡ Which backend language do you want for the microservices?

Node.js

Python (FastAPI / Flask)

Go (best for microservices, optional)

Tell me your choice and I will start building Project 1 end-to-end with full code + K8s YAML + diagrams + explanation.
