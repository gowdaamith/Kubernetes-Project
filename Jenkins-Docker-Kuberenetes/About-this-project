A full pipeline that build's docker image -> pushes to registry -> deploy to kubernetess

Components:
*Simple Node.js / python app
*Dockerfile
*Jenkins pipeline(Declarative ro scripted)
*Kubernetes Deployment + Services
*Rolling Updatess on every code change

What we will be learning here:
*Shows CI/CD + K8s integration 

Project: CI/CD Pipeline  using Jenkins  + Kubernetes

Build a pipelline that : 
1.Pull source code from Github
2.Build a Docker image
3.Pushes it to DockerHub
4.Deploy to kubernetes (Minikube)
5.Does Rolling updates automatically
